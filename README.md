"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Brian Kernighan

# Hola!

Welcome to my little corner of the digital universe! I'm Sahil, a dev who enjoys crafting code, solving puzzles, and occasionally breaking things (oops!). Here's a little taste of what you'll find in this repository:

## About Me

- 🚀 Aspiring rocket scientist turned code wizard.
- 💻 Constantly typing away at my keyboard, fueled by coffee and the occasional chocolate chip cookie.
- 🎨 Turning caffeine into code and bugs into features since 2021.
- 🌱 Always learning, forever curious.

## My Tech Stack

- 🔧 Languages: Java, Python, Dart, Typescript, Go

## Let's Connect 🚀

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about coding, share memes, or debate the best programming language. You can shoot me an email at [sahil.rathee@infortts.com].

Thanks for stopping by! Now, go forth and code with reckless abandon (but maybe also a little bit of caution).

Keep calm and code on! ✌️
