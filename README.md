"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." - Brian Kernighan

# Greetings !

Step into my quantum realm of the digital cosmos, where every bit and byte exists in a superposition of states, awaiting observation!
I'm a developer (no surprises there), who enjoys crafting code, solving puzzles, and occasionally breaking things (oops!).

## About Me

- 🧙‍♂️ Aspiring physicist turned tech enthusiast.
- 💻 Constantly typing away at my keyboard, fueled by coffee and the occasional chocolate chip cookie.
- 🎨 Turning ideas into code and bugs into features (mostly!) since 2021.

## My Tech Stack

- 🔧 Languages: kotlin, python, dart, typescript, go.
- 📚 Currently diving deep into: NP Completeness, AI/ML.

## My Craft

- ☕ Mug of coffee + debug mode.
- 🎶 Each line of code with its own soundtrack: from Bach to Schubert.

## For Contributions

These projects thrives on collaborations. Whether you have suggestions for improvement, bugs to report, or ideas for new features, your contributions are incredibly valuable. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues – Join the coding circus and let's juggle some bytes together – the more, the merrier!

## Let's Connect 🚀

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about coding, or debate the best programming language. You can shoot me an email at [sahil.git@outlook.com].

Thanks for stopping by! Now, go forth and code with reckless abandon (but maybe also a little bit of caution).
